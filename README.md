# OsuApiTest
> A project test of Osu's support for API

I was playing Osu! and constantly checking how much PP I gained in each map, same for ranking

So I was wondering if I could build a tool, maybe a script that tracks my pp and ranking so each time I play a map it tells me how much I got

I suppose someone already did some script like that, but since I've never tried Osu API I thought it would be a great oportunity

I should be doing it in **Python**
